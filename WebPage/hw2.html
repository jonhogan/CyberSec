            <p class = "textColor"> Ok, maybe I could have chosen an image that seems a little less stereotypical and humorous, however, given their music videos,
                I think Brothers of Metal would approve. There is no way I could list all the metal bands from the Nordic countries, instead
                this will be a few of the ones I personally enjoy listening to.

            <p class = "textColor">Depending on your music taste, you may 
                have heard of a few of these groups. Keep in mind this is
                not a full list of all metal/rock groups from the region,
                just a few I like to listen to.</p>
