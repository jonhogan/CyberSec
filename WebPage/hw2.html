            <p class = "textColor"> Ok, maybe I could have chosen an image that seems a little less stereotypical and humorous, however, given their music videos,
                I think Brothers of Metal would approve. There is no way I could list all the metal bands from the Nordic countries, instead
                this will be a few of the ones I personally enjoy listening to.
            </p>
            <p class = "textColor">Depending on your music taste, you may 
                have heard of a few of these groups. Keep in mind this is
                not a full list of all metal/rock groups from the region,
                just a few I like to listen to.</p>

                    <p> Formed in 1996, in Kitee, Finland by lead songwriter and keyboardist
                        Tuomas Holopainen, guitarist Emppu Vuorinen, and former lead singer Tarja Turunen.</p>
                    <p>Current members are:

                    </p>

                    <p>For nearly 30 years, Nightwish has consistently proven why they are seen
                       as <em>the</em> Symphonic Metal band.

                    <p>While she is not a band, I would be remiss not to give Floor Jansen
                    her own spot. Known lovingly as the Valkyrie Goddess by the "Nightwish Army", she has been
                    a member of After Forever, ReVamp, Northward, Nightwish as well as working on her
                    solo career. </p>
                <p>Born February 21, 1981 she was just 16 when she joined After Forever, and was with them until the group
                    disbanded in 2009. After which she formed ReVamp and released two albums with them. In 2012 she joined Nightwish on their
                    Imaginaerum World Tour after Anette Olzon departed, becoming an official member in 2013.</p>

                    <p class  = "textColor">What can I say about Brothers of Metal? Their music videos
                        look like a group of friends out LARPing. This may be my favorite thing about the group,
                        though they still have some bangers. Formed in 2012, Brothers of Metal is a Swedish
                        power metal band from Smedjebacken and Falun. Currently they have two albums, Prophecy 
                        of Ragnarok released in 2017, and Emblas Saga released in 2020.
