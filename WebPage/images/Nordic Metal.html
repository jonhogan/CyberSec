            <p class="textColor"> Ok, maybe I could have chosen an image
 that seems a little less stereotypical and humorous, however, given 
their music videos,
                I think Brothers of Metal would approve. There is no way
 I could list all the metal bands from the Nordic countries, instead
                this will be a few of the ones I personally enjoy 
listening to.
            </p>
            <p class="textColor">Depending on your music taste, you may 
                have heard of a few of these groups. Keep in mind this is
                not a full list of all metal/rock groups from the region,
                just a few I like to listen to.</p>

                    <p>In my very humble, and also correct, opinion, no list of

                    <p>With nearly 30 years, Nightwish has put out some great songs, and
                        consistently prove why they are seen as <em>the</em> Symphonic Metal band.

                    <p>While she is not a band, I would be remiss not to give Floor Jansen
                    her own spot. Known lovingly as the Valkyrie Goddess by the "Nightwish Army", she has been
                    a member of After Forever, ReVamp, Northward, Nightwish as well as working on her
                    solo career. </p>
                <p>Born February 21, 1981 she was just 16 when she 
joined After Forever, and was with them until the group
                    disbanded in 2009. After which she formed ReVamp and
 released two albums with them. In 2012 she joined Nightwish on their
                    Imaginaerum World Tour after Anette Olzon departed, 
becoming an official member in 2013.</p>
