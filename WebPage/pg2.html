      <p>
        At this point, everyone loves to hate Comic Sans. It's not an attractive
        fount, in fact far from it. But what if the point of a font isn't the
        look, but the ability to ensure your readers can read it?

        We've seen the memes. We've made the jokes. We know Comic Sans is ugly,
        and over used. We should know it has its place and

          uses</a
        >. Why is this a good use for this much maligned font? It is easier for
        those with
        <a href="https://cisl.cast.org/research/font-choice">dyslexia</a> to
        read and retain.

      <p>
        This is not to say that there are no other font types to use, but when
        it comes to the preinstalled, widely know fonts, the odds are, everyone
        knows Comic Sans. I am not saying that you should exclusively use Comic
        Sans. I mean, look at this page, it's horrible. However, all the letters
        are distinct, and not easily confused.

        Disclaimer:
        <p>
          Please don't use Comic Sans. There are other font types that are
          easy/easier for those with Dyslexia to read. If you are doing it to be
          on inclusive, then I applaud your efforts. However, here is a list of
          fonts that can help achieve the same end goal while still looking
          clean and professional:

          <li>Arial (Used here)</li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/opendyslexic"
              >Open-Dyslexic</a
            >
          </li>
          <li style="font-family: Verdana">Verdana</li>
          <li style="font-family: Tahoma">Tahoma</li>
          <li style="font-family: Century Gothic">Century Gothic</li>
          <li style="font-family: Calibri">Calibri</li>
          These are not the only fonts that you can use. So lets move past Comic
          Sans, while still creating a more open and inclusive web for all.
