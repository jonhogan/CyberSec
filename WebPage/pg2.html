    <h1 class="textCenter">Don't Hate Comic Sans</h1>

    <p>
      At this point, everyone loves to hate Comic Sans. It's not an attractive
      fount, in fact far from it. But what if the point of a font isn't the
      look, but the ability to ensure your readers can read it?
    </p>

    Sans" height="360" class = "imgCenter">

    <p>
      We've seen the memes. We've made the jokes. We know Comic Sans is ugly, and
      over used. We should know it has its place and

        uses</a
      >. Why is this a good use for this much maligned font? It is easier for
      those with
      <a href="https://cisl.cast.org/research/font-choice">dyslexia</a> to read
      and retain.

    <p>
      This is not to say that there are no other font types to use, but when it
      comes to the preinstalled, widely know fonts, the odds are, everyone knows
      Comic-Sans. I am not saying that you should exclusively use Comic-Sans. I
      mean, look at this page, it's horrible. However, all the letters are
      distinct, and not easily confused.

    <h5 class = "noComic">Disclaimer:<p> Please don't use Comic - Sans. There are other font types that
        are easy/easier for those with Dyslexia to read. And they have the benefit of
        not looking horrible.
